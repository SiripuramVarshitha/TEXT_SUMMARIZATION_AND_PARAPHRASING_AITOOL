📘 PROJECT TITLE:
Text Summarization and Paraphrasing Tool Using AI Models
OVERVIEW:
This project is an AI-powered web application designed to automatically summarize and paraphrase long pieces of text using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. It aims to make content shorter, clearer, and easier to understand.

🚀 FEATURES:

Secure Authentication: User login and signup with JWT token-based security.

Automated Text Summarization: Generates concise summaries using transformer models like BART.

Paraphrasing: Rewrites text with preserved meaning and improved readability.

Translation Support: Allows text translation to multiple languages.

Admin Dashboard: Provides insights into user activity, summaries generated, and feedback.

Feedback System: Collects user feedback to improve the tool’s performance.

⚙️ TECH STACK:

Frontend: Streamlit (for building an interactive web interface)

Backend: FastAPI (for handling API requests efficiently)

Database: MySQL (for storing user data, feedback, and generated summaries)

AI Models: Hugging Face Transformers (BART, Pegasus, T5, etc.)

🌟 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing can make text handling smarter and faster.
By combining Streamlit for frontend, FastAPI for backend, and Transformer-based NLP models, we created a reliable and user-friendly text processing system.
